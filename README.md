NOTE: This is basically garbage unless you are me, I'm just checking out how to make a new module.  Forked to learn! 


Expands the [Dungeon Crawl Classics system](https://github.com/cyface/foundryvtt-dcc/) for the [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com) to include Brytest character sheets.
